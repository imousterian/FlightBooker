A flight booking app allowing a user to purchase tickets. The app integrates SendGrid and sends a confirmation email upon booking.

This project was done as a part of [The Odin Project curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/sending-confirmation-emails).

A demo is available [here](https://one-way-ticket.herokuapp.com).
